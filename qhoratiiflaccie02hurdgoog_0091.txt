²³[hnd lilre the‘tyrannons Breathing ol the North
“’ Sbuts all our Buds frorn blowing—

If this correffion be allowed, every thing is per-
feffly right. lt is properly the breathing, the
'cold breath of the North, that lhuts up'the
Buds when they are on the point of blowing.
whence the epithet tyrannous will be understood
*not as implying the idea of blnst'ring (an idea
indeed necessary if we retain the word fhakes)
hut simply of cruel, the tyranny of this wind con-
fisting in imprisoning the flower in its Bud and
glenying it the liberty of coming out into B'lofflm.
2The application too of thio'comparison, which
required the change of growing into howing,
seems also to require the present alteration of
finales. For there was no manner of violence in
thefather's coming in upon the lovers. All the
,effect was, that his presence restrained them
from that interchange of tendet words, which
„tvae going to take place between them. '

Thus farI had written in the last edition of
these notes, and I, now, see no cause to douht
the general truth and propriety of thie emenda-
tion. Only it occurs to iiie that, instead of
couvre, the poet's own word might, perhaps‚·be ἡ
errrorem as not only being more like in found
to the word fhaln, but αξ coming neerer to the

traces
