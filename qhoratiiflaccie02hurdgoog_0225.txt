. “dim formae sunt treet· Palliatae, Togata,

‘'‘ Atellanae, salibus etjocis compositae, quae in se
“ non habent nisi vetustam elegantiam.'' [Proh
'in Terent] And *Athenaeus [l. vi] speaking
‘os some pieces os this sort, which L. Sylla had
composed2 calls them Caivpnoit κωμῳδίαις, satyric
comedies3 comeair'en because, as Donatus says,
“ salibus et jocis composttae :’' and satyric, not
that satyra were introduced in-·them, but, accord-
'ing to Diomedes, from their being “argumentis
“'disiisquesmilas satyricis sabulis Graecis.’' Os
what then can Ovid be understood to speak‚ but
the tru'e satyric piece, which was always esteem·
ed, and, as appears from the Cyclops, in sa& is,

what Demetrius [wrpi'ippwa'as] elegantly calls it,
τραγῳδία stargina, alighter kind os tragedy3 the
¹very name, which Horace, as well as Ovid ,in

this place, gives to it? But this is further clear
srorn the instance quoted by ovid, os this loose ·
tragedy3 sor he proceeds:

unimanus,mortemqurflca Achillem,
Instegi esuisfortia sacia modis.

which well agrees to the idea osa satyric piece,
· and, as Voffius takes notice, see'rns to be the very*
same subjesh which Athenaeus and others tell

us, Sophocles had work’d into a satyric tragedy‚
under the title of Ἀχιλλέως spartei.
