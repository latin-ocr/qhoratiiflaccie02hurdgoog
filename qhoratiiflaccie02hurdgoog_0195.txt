For this distinguiihes their case from that of the
,nutrio who upon receiving the 'account of
Jason's crueln’es, cries ou-r, “ ”
·”ΟλοιΊο μὶν μὴ, honoror γοῖξ ἔς’ ipah,

““ ἈΊᾶρᾷακίς γ’ ὃν εἷς φίλες insanin. ' '
And that the chorus enrer'd into Medca's'dcsrgns
against her husband, the tyrant Creon, ond hcr
rival, oo reasons of justice and equity only, and ·
not (as is hastily believed by some, who hare
not enough attended rothe decorum of the an-
tient tragedy) for the sake of forwarding the
poet's plot, may be certainly ihewn. For when,
in the fury of her resentmentssand as thc full
completion of her revenge, the mother corneo
to propose the murder of her innocent children,
the 'chorus starts with horror at the thought,
,diss‘uadcs her from it in the most earncst and
affeciing manner [g]‚ and seems¹ to have con-
cealed the dreadful secret only from the persua-
sron, that it was too horrid and unnaturalro
be, perpretated. The reader will colle& thir

to the lawr,

Σέ τ’ ω’φιλεῖν hincce, ις νόμοις &paror

Ξυλλαμζάνεσα, isole o’ οἷπεννέπω vaih, ἦ 812·

which strenis, that the other murdero were not against

thetgpirit of the laws, whatever became of the letter
