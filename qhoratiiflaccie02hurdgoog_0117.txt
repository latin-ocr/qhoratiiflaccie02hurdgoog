‚tre perfec‘fly natural. To use them in his cool
and quiet moments, when he has no great inter·
ests to prosecute or extricato himself from, is

'direttly against Nature. Por, in this stete os
things, he mustscek them, is he will have thern. ·
And when he has got them and made his best
use of thern, what do they produce? Not subli-
mity‚ but Bombast. For it is not the figuret,
but the suitableness to the raaſson, that produces
either. Not that I am ignorant that there are ’
vices in the formation of figures, as well asin
their application. But these vices go under vati-

ous other names. The pure simple Bombast (is 1
may be indulged so bold a catachresrs) arises
from putting figurative expression to an impro-
per use. To give an instance of what I mean.
Therrus writes under one continued resent-
ment at the degeneracy of his times, and speak-
ing of some sumptuary Laws proposed by the
senate, in 2Ann. c. 33, he says they decreed,
Nc Vestis· Serica viros rotonum. This be-

came the dignity os his historic charaster and
genius. But had his Contemporary, Suetonius, Ι

who wrote Chronicles in the spirit os our Srow
and Horruosr'rrntn used the same language, it
would have set his readers a laughing.

Not but figurative expreffion, even-when suit-
