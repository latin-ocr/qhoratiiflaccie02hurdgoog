2 Thq same conclusionis drawn from con
fidering tdestate of the reader. For, hurried away
by an instindlive impatience, he pursuea the pro-
posed event with eagerness and rapidity. So
circumstantial adetail, as was supposed, of an
intermediate adlion not neceffarily connedl'ed
with it, breaks the course of his expediations,
and throws forward the point ol view to an
immoderate distance. In the mean time the
atrion, thus interposed and presented to his
thoughts, acquires by degrees, and at length
ingrolles his whole attention. It becomes the
important theme of the picce; or, at· least ‚what
follows sets¹ out with the disadvantage of appear ·

But now being related by way of episode, that '

is, as a succindi, summary narration, not made

by the poet himself, but coming from the mouth ,

of a person, necessarily ingaged in the progress
of the astion, it serves for a lhort time to inter-¹
rupt, and, -by that interruption to harpen, the
eager expediation of the reader. It holds the
attention, for a while, from the main point of
view3 yet not long enough to destroy that im· ⁴
patient curiosity, which looks forward to it.
