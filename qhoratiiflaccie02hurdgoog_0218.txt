'tesorted to for recreation ae well as instrudlion, ··’
und a knowledge in morals was the supreme ac-
'conrplilhment in vogue: The fruit of these
philosophica} conferences would naturally lhew
itself in certain brief, sententious-conclusum,
which would neither contraditi the falhion,
' nor, it seems, offend against the ease and gaiety
of conversation in those times. Schools and pe-
dantry, moruls and austerity, were not soell'en·
tially connected, in their combinatione of ideas,
as they have been since 3 ¹and asensrble moral
truth might have fallen from any mouth, with-
out disgracingit. Nay, which is very remark-
able, the very scholia, as they were called, ot
drinking catches of the Greeks, were scaioned
with this moral turn; the sallies of pleasuntry‚
which escaped them in their freest house, being
tempercd for the most part, by some strokes of
this national sobriety. “ During the course of
“their entertainmenn, says Athenaeus, [l. xv.

‘² c. 14] they loved to hear, from some wiseand
“ prudent person, an agrceable song: and those
⁴⁶ songs were held by them most agreealile‚

“which contained exhortations to virtue, ot

“other iustrudiions relatiie to their conduct
“ln life?

And to gire the render a triste of these moral
longe, lv ill tahel eave to present him witha

very line one, written by no less a person than
Aristotle
