¹Now these ¹'two kinds-of the tpistle, as they '

this happened. Satine, in its origin, Ι mean in
the rude s βιιιιιὶιιι βινιι, from which the idea of
this poem was taken, was a merc extemporane-
ous jumblc of mirth and ill· nature. Euurus,
who had the honour ol introducing rt under ιιι
new name, without doubt crvrlrzcd both yet left
it without form or method3 rt being only, ιιι his¹
¹hands, arhapsody of poems on different subjedls,
and in different mensures. Common sense dis-
‚claiming the extrayagance of this heterogeneous
mixture, Lucrurus advanced it, in ‘its next step,
to an unity ol deſsgn and metm which was so
considerable a change, that it procured him the
high appellation of Ιιιιιιιιοι of this poem.
