A‘RT OF POETRY. 163

This is the applicationes what hath been said5
in general, concerning the resinement os thea-
tricas musrc to the case os tragedy. Some com·
mentators say, and to comedy. But in this they
mistake, as will appear presently. M. Dacier
hath‚I know not what conceit about a com·
parison betwixt the Romen and Greek stage. His
reason is, that the lyra was used in the Greek chorus,
or appears, he faya, from Sophocles playing upon
this irssrument himself in one of his tragedia.
And was it not used too in the Roman choros,
as appears from Nero's playing upon it in several
tragedies? But the learned critic did not appre-
hend this matter. Indeed from the cantion,
with which his guides, the dealers in antiquitiee,
always touch this point, it should seem, that
they too.¹ had no very clear conceptione os it.

aa being most proper to accompany the decla·
mation os the adis, cantantiſsrccr'nere, was con-
stantly employed, aa well in the Roman tragedy
as comedy. This appears srom many authori-
ties. Imention only two from Cicero. Quam
