eto] [from fi 202 tomo] This is one ot'
those many passages in the epistlc‚ about which

mus1c; but, in a short digresswe history (such aa

the didaslic form will sometimes require) to
describe the rise and progress os the true. This

I collect, 1. From the eapreffion irſsels; which
cannot, without violence, be understood in any
other way. For, as to the words licentia aod

tiousneyi, properly so called 3 and the other only
expresses a vehemence and rapidity of lunguagc,

naturally productiva of a quicker elocutum, such
as must os course attend the more numerous
lrarmony of the lyre z—not, as M. Dacier trans·
lates it, une eloquente rernteraire et outre'r, an ex,
travagant straining and all'eclation os style.
a. From the reason os the thing 3 which makes it
incredible, that the musicos the theatre should
then be most complete, when the times were
turbatoris, aud entertainments os this kind littlc

,encouraged or understood. 3, From thr character
