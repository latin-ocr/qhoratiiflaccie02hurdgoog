may have fallen under observatiom'tbab will·
justiiy the poet in carrying the expreffion'of·
such -a resentment to any extreme. History'
would, perhaps, furniih examples, in which a:
virtuous¹ resentment hatb been carried even iar-
ther than is here represented by the poet. What?¹
way then of determining the precise bounds and
limits of it? Only by observing in numerous
instances, i. c, from a large extenhve knowledge
of practica! life, how far it usually, in such
charadiers, and under such circumstances, pre·
vails. Hence a differente of representation will
¹ arise in proportion to the extent of that knev-
· ltdge. Let us now see, how the charadter before
ιιεςΙ harh, in fact, been managed by Euripides.
in that'frne scene, which paises between
Eiedtra· and Orestes, whom as yet the suspe&
not to be-her brother, the conversation very* ne· ·
tu‘rally turns upon· Eledtra’s distreiies, and the·
author of them, Clytytaemnestra‚ as well as on
her hopes of deliveranoe from them by the means

of Orestes The diaiogue upon this proceeds:

Or. What then of Orestes, were he to return ·
to this Argos Ρ .
ΕΙ. Ah! wherefore that question, when there
is no prospe& of his return at all? .
‘.Or But supposrng he should return, how

would he go about to revenge the death of his
father. Ρ·
