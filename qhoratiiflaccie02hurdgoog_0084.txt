of terme, according to their etymology, were al-
ways the most proper. Α
But Mr. Dacier has a reason of his own for
confining the precept to this meaning. “ The
question, he says, is de verbis serendi53 and there-
fore this juntlura must be explained of new
words, properly so called, as compound epithets'
are3 and not of the grace of novelty which sin-'
gle words'seem to acquire from the art of dis·
poling of theml'
· By which we understand, that the learned
critic did not perceive the scope of his author3
which was manifestly this. “ The invention of
‘⁶ new terms, says he, being a matter of much
‘⁴‘ nicety, Ι had rather you would contrive to ern-r
’ “ ploy known words in such a way as to give
“them the effe& of new ones. 'Tis true, new
“words may sometimes be necessary: And if
“ so‚” διε. Whence we see that the line, ' Ι·

the following line, as the example. ·On the
' other hand, the rule isjust mentioned carelessy
and in paffing, while the poetis hastening to an·
other consideration of more importance, and
which he even oppofis to the former. “ Instead ⁸
