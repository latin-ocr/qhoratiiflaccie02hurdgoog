Cicero says, Philosophia quidem tantum obest rit
proinde, ac de hominum est vitri merita, laudetur, ut
a plerisque neglella, a multis etiam vituperetur. In ’
another place he tells 'us‚ that in his time Aristo-
tle was not much known, or read, even by the

philosophers themselves. [Cic. Top. sub inis] ’ .

And, though in the ageos Seneca, Sentences,
we know, were much in use, yet the cast and
turn os them evidently shew them to have been' Ι
the affectation os the letteredsew, and not the
general mode and praelice os the time. For the

quaintness, in which Senecas aphorisms are
¹ dressed, manifestly speaks the labour and artifice
os the closer, and rs just the reverse os that easy,
simple expression, which cloaths them m the
Greek poete, thus demonstrating their familiar
currency in common life. Under any other-
circumstances than these, the prastice, aa was

· observed, must be unquestionably faulty, ex

cept only m the chorus ,where, for the reaspn

before given, it may always with good adven
tage, be employed.
