objetibs not vifible may sometimes obtain the name
of beauty‚ for no other reason than because the
imagination is agreeably employed about thern} ’

as the other, but that in both cases we 'are
phnfid, and that in both the imaginatien contri·

from confidering beauty as a distinet excellenoe
in such productioris. For we may distinguite,
either in apislure or poem, between the plea- ·
sures we receive direilly from the imitation of

rrifiblrforms, and those which principally depend
