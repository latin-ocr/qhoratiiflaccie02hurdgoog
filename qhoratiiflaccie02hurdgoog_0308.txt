,ὦ [nomes orirer:

343. Mrscurr urrrr ¹nutet. The¹ unna·
tural separation of the nurcr rr uma hath
done almost as much hurt in btters as that of
the uenierunt ann urina, which Tully some-

where com'plains of, hath done in marols. For·
while the polite writer, as he is called, contents

himself with the· former of these qualities, and
the man of erudition with the latter, it comes to
pass, as the same writer expreffes it, that rr·
poem ELOQJENTIA roaurnars, ar markus
arreins nocrama nrhsrr [Orat. iii]

363. Hanc amar oracutum, ronan aare
rua ruer warna] Cicero hath given the
same precept in relation tn oratory, habear illa in
arcendo admiratio ac summa laus umbram aliquam
et ruffam, qua magis id, quad erit illuminatam,
mare arque eminere videatur· [De orat. l. iii.
c. xxvi]

373. Mamocrrnns essa rorrrs Nonnonn·
urs, ete] This judgment‚ however severe it
may seem, is according to the praetice of the
best cr'itics. We have a remarkable instance in
the case of Apollonius Rhodius, wh0‚ though, in

, 'the judgment of Qrinffllian, the author osa,
no contemptible poem, yet, on account of that
equal mediocrity, which every where prevails in

him,
