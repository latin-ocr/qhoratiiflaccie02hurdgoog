INTRODUCTION. v·

at is here lhewn, of the Roman drama ln parti-
cular. But there ie something more to be ob-
served, in the case of Herwsrus. For, as will be

made appear in the notes on particular places, this
critic did not pervert the order of the piece„from

azsrmple millake about the drift ol the subjedl,

but, allo‚·from a total inapprehensron of the
genuin charm and beauty of the epislolory matbod.
And, because l take this to bea principal cause
of the wrong interpretatione, that have been
given of all the epistles of Horace3 and it is, .
in itself, a point of curious criticism, of which
little or nothing *harh been said by any good
writer, I will take the liberty to enlarge upon it.
THE Errsrtr, however various in its appear-
- ancos, is, inrfad't, but of two kinds; one of which
may lte-called the Drnnc'r103 the other, the
Errornc cpistle. By the rrrsr Ι mean all those
opistles, whole end is to instruct 3 whether the
subja& be morah, politics, criticism, or, in ge-
nerali human life: by the tnrrrn, all those,
whose end is to move5 whether the occalion be
love,sriend]hip, jaalousy, or other private distrelles.
If :there¹ are someof a lighter kind in Horace,
and other good writers, which seem not reducible
to, either of these two clalles, they are to be re·
garded only, aa, the triflings of their pen, and
deserve not to he considered, as making a third
and distinct· species of this poem. ·
