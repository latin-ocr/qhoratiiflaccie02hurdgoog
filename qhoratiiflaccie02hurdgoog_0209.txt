cannot doubt of is, 1. That the several theatrica}
dances of the antients were striffly conformable
· to the genius of the different species of compo·
sition, to which they were applied. a. Thatt
therefore, the tragic darec, which more espe-.
cially accompanied the chorus, must have been
expressive of the highest gravity and decorum,·
tending to inspire ideas of what is hemming,
grateful, and majestic3 in which view we cannot
but perceive the important affistance it must
needs lend to virtue, and how greatly it must
contribute to set all her grates and attraffions

g in the fairest light. 3. This idea of the antient

tragic dance, is not solely formed upon our
knowledge of the conformhy, beforementioned;
but is further colledted from the name, usually

given to it, which was Εμμέλεια. This word
cannot well be transsated into our language3
but exprcffes all that grace and concinnity of
Α motion, which the dignity of the chora} song
required. 4. Lastly, it must give us a very
high notion of the moral effect of this dance,
when we hnd the severe Plato admitting it into
his commonwealth.
