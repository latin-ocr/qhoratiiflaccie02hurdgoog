Whieh last, instance Ithe rather give for the
sake os proposrhg an emendation, which Ι ιἰιιιιιι
restores this fine passage to its Integrity Before

. the late edition os Shakespear ιι stood thus, .·.-.

And like the tyrannous breathing os the North
Shakes all our Buds sr'onr growmg- Νι.

But the sagacious Editor saw that this reading
was corrupt, and therefore altered the last word,
growing, sor unanswerable reasons, rnto blrwsng.
Se'e Μι. W's. note upon the place. This ssight
'change'gives propriet'p and beatty to the passage,
'which before had no sortos meaning, Yet stru

ι 'all is not quite right. For, as- the great Critic

hintsels observes, ‘⁶ Brenthing ιι ιιοι a very pro-
per word to express the rage and ¹bluster os· the
north wind.'' Bestdes, one does not see how
the fhaking os these Buds is properly affign'd'as
the ca'use os their not blowing. ἰΤιιίι wind
rnight shake off the bloffoms of a fruit-trec, i. α
' the Buds when they were full-bsown3 br'rt' so
long a‘s the bloffom lies folded up in the Bud, it
seems secure from sh'aking. At least the shaking
“is nottheimmediute cause os the effeet, sp'ok'en
os, itis fimply the cold of the north-wind th'zt
eloses the Bud¹ and keeps it from blowing. I arn
therefore tempted »ιο propose another alteration
os the texta* and to read thus, ’
