.To set thia three-sold character, in the lullesi
light, before the view of the render, l have at-
tempted to explane the Epistle to tha Pisas, in
the way of continued commentary upon it.
And, that the coherence of the several parts may
be the more ‹listinffly seen, the Comrnentary is
rendered as concise as possible, some os the
finer and less obvious connexions being more
carefully observed and drawn out in the notes.
For the kind of interpretation itself, it must
be allowed, os all others, the fittest to throw
light upon a difficolt and obscure subjeci, and,
above all, to convey an exa& idea os the scope
and order of any work. It hath, accordingly,
‘been so confidered by several os the foreign, par- ,
ticularly the ITALIAN, critics; who have es-
sayed long fince to illustrate, in this way, the
very piece before us. But the firccess of these
foreigners ir, l am senfible, a ssendcr recom-
mendation os their methad. l chuse therefore to
· rest on the fingle authority of a great author,
who, in his edition of our English Horace, the
best that ever was given of any claffic, hath now
retrieved and established the full creditos it.
