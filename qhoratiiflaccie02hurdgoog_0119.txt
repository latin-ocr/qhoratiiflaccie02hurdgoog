' parison) what we see of trained Apes. But

when the violent pallrons arise (as ιη the case os

the proper language 01 Pullion, whether we chuse
'to consider tt as endobling‚ or debasrng the hu

There rs, as I have said, an obvious distindhon
to be made (and to that the poet’s rule,¹ as ex
plained in this note, refers) between the soft
and tendet, and the more vigorous passione.
When the former prevail‚ the mind rs in a weak
languid' state3 and though all allusion and rma-
gery be· not improper here‚¹ yet as that lire and

energy 01 the soul is wanting, which gives a fa·
cility'of ranging over our ideas and 01 seizing

such as may be turned to any resemblance 01 our ·
own* condition, it will sor that reason be 1011110-
quent in this stateof the mind than any other.

Suchimagery, too, will for thelame reason be
lenstriking, because the same languid affedlions

died to, and make us acquiesce rn a simplet and
